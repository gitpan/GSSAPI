DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  An installed Version of GSS-API bindings, e.g

  MIT Kerberos <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/>
  Heimdal      <http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/>
  VAS          <http://www.quest.com/>

This GSSAPI-implementations ship with a command called 'krb5-config'.
Make sure the krb5-config command is present and executeable,
Makefile.PL needs it to detect the library configuration.

OS specific notes:

- Windows - MIT KfW SDK:

  This SDK does not provide the krb5-config command,
  <http://www.mail-archive.com/kerberos%40mit.edu/msg12808.html>.
  Instead of using krb5-config you need to specifiy the compiler and linker flags
  on the perl Makefile.PL commandline. run
      perl Makefile.PL --help
  to see all available configuration options.

- NetBSD:

  since 2006-01-26 krb5-config is present
  in pkgsrc/security/heimdal, see
  <http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2006/01/26/0036.html
