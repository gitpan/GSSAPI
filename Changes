Revision history for Perl extension GSSAPI.

0.01  Fri Aug 18 22:14:18 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.4 with options
		-x -n GSSAPI -p gss_ /home/local/perl/GSSAPI/foo/gssapi.h

0.02  Mon Aug 28 01:07:30 2000
	- Redid typemaps to separate input, optional-input, output,
	  optional-output, and const-output.
	- Add GSSAPI::is_valid() to allow users to test whether a NULL
	  object was returned.  Made all sub-modules except GSSAPI::Binding
	  into actual subclasses by setting @ISA in each to include
	  GSSAPI itself.
	- Add DESTROY method to GSSAPI::Context that deletes the context,
	  ignoring any errors.

0.10  Mon Aug 28 18:17:27 2000
	- Use SvOK() instead of comparing to &PL_sv_undef
	- Add gss_buffer_desc_out
	- Don't do the sv_setref_iv on output of PTROBJ_ or PTROBJ_OPT
	  if the value isn't changing.  This keeps the value from being
	  destructed while in use.
	- Because of that change, new() methods now return foo_out types
	- Newline terminate the stringification of a GSSAPI::Status object
	- This version has actually worked

0.11  Tue Aug 29 22:03:41 2000
	- Add a README file and clean up the POD in GSSAPI.pm

0.12  Tue Nov  6 10:48:54 2001
	- Remove some unused constants from the .xs file.
	- Added missing '&'s to Context::accept and Context::export
	  method implementations.  Thanks to Jacob Gorm Hansen <jg@ioi.dk>
	  for finding this.

0.13  Thu Mar 24 10:46:59 2005
	- Actually document this module as being under the same
	  license as Perl (how did I miss this?!?)

0.14 Mo Feb  6 18:46:21 CET 2006

	- Maintanance overtaken by Achim Grolms. Thank you Philip!
	  our base is
	  <http://perlgssapi.sourceforge.net/>
	- deleted gss_mech_set_krb5_v1v2(), gss_mech_set_krb5_v2()
	  from OID__Set.xs. It makes the compile fail
	- deleted gss_mech_krb5_v2() from OID.xs
	- deletd gss_mech_set_krb5_v2, gss_mech_set_krb5_v1v2 from GSSAPI.xs
	- gss_str_to_oid() and gss_oid_to_str()
	  are not present in Heimdal implementations.
	  I've ifdefed them to croak.
	  Testsuite is adjusted to skip them.
	- Added patches from Merijn Broeren to typemap file.
	  this fixes (hopefully) http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=5681
	  Just grep the file for "Merijn", I've marked the sections
	- Added destructor to Cred.xs (Thanks Merijn!)
0.15
	- added options (2) (3) (4) to Makefile.PL
	  to make the configuration more flexible
	  (if needed). Thanks Merijn!

0.16	- changed Context.xs Destructor to warn only on GSS_S_FAILURE
	(see <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=9674417&forum_id=47637>)
	- Makefile.PL passes all the (needed!)
	  krb5-config --libs gssapi stuff that is
	  ignored by LIBS to LDDLFLGAS
	- Tried to add userdocumentation to GSSAPI.pm (GSSAPI::Name)

0.17	So Feb 12 21:52:41 CET 2006

	- use of uppercase GSS_ style import-constants instead of lowercase
	  gss_ constants. Hope this does not break things, please
	  let me know if that means problems on your platform!
	- deleted mechtype sets gss_mech_set_krb5,
	  gss_mech_set_krb5_old, gss_mech_set_krb5_both, gss_mech_set_krb5.
	  Please let me know if that breaks your code and needs to be fixed!
	- added example gss-client.pl and gss-server.pl
	  (Thanks Merijn!)
	- added SPNEGO Mechttype to OID.xs
	- made the test.pl list available Mechtypes
	- added indicate_mechs Example to POD

0.18	Tu Feb 14 12:53:14 UTC 2006

	- inline definition of
	  __GSS_KRB5_NT_USER_NAME
	  __GSS_KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL_NAME
	  __gss_mech_krb5_v2 ( gss_mech_krb5_v2 is back)
	  to make module independent from GSSAPI implementations
	  which does not export the symbols.
	  See <http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/krbdev/2005-February/003193.html>
	- splitted tests to separate files in t/
	  Make tests runable separately.
