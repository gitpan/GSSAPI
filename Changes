Revision history for Perl extension GSSAPI.

0.01  Fri Aug 18 22:14:18 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.4 with options
		-x -n GSSAPI -p gss_ /home/local/perl/GSSAPI/foo/gssapi.h

0.02  Mon Aug 28 01:07:30 2000
	- Redid typemaps to separate input, optional-input, output,
	  optional-output, and const-output.
	- Add GSSAPI::is_valid() to allow users to test whether a NULL
	  object was returned.  Made all sub-modules except GSSAPI::Binding
	  into actual subclasses by setting @ISA in each to include
	  GSSAPI itself.
	- Add DESTROY method to GSSAPI::Context that deletes the context,
	  ignoring any errors.

0.10  Mon Aug 28 18:17:27 2000
	- Use SvOK() instead of comparing to &PL_sv_undef
	- Add gss_buffer_desc_out
	- Don't do the sv_setref_iv on output of PTROBJ_ or PTROBJ_OPT
	  if the value isn't changing.  This keeps the value from being
	  destructed while in use.
	- Because of that change, new() methods now return foo_out types
	- Newline terminate the stringification of a GSSAPI::Status object
	- This version has actually worked

0.11  Tue Aug 29 22:03:41 2000
	- Add a README file and clean up the POD in GSSAPI.pm

0.12  Tue Nov  6 10:48:54 2001
	- Remove some unused constants from the .xs file.
	- Added missing '&'s to Context::accept and Context::export
	  method implementations.  Thanks to Jacob Gorm Hansen <jg@ioi.dk>
	  for finding this.

0.13  Thu Mar 24 10:46:59 2005
	- Actually document this module as being under the same
	  license as Perl (how did I miss this?!?)

	-Maintanace overtaken by Achim Grolms. Thank you Philip!

	 <http://perlgssapi.sourceforge.net/>
	 -deleted gss_mech_set_krb5_v1v2(), gss_mech_set_krb5_v2()
	 from OID__Set.xs. It makes the compile fail
	 -deleted gss_mech_krb5_v2() from OID.xs
	 -deletd gss_mech_set_krb5_v2, gss_mech_set_krb5_v1v2 from GSSAPI.xs
	 -gss_str_to_oid() and gss_oid_to_str()
	  are not present in Heimdal implementations.
	  I've ifdefed them to croak.
	  Testsuite is adjusted to skip them.
	-Added patches from Merijn Broeren to typemap file.
	 this fixes (hopefully) http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=5681
	 Just grep the file for "Merijn", I've marked the sections
	-Added destructor to Cred.xs (Thanks Merijn!)
0.15
	-added options (2) (3) (4) to Makefile.PL
