Revision history for Perl extension GSSAPI.

0.01  Fri Aug 18 22:14:18 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.4 with options
		-x -n GSSAPI -p gss_ /home/local/perl/GSSAPI/foo/gssapi.h

0.02  Mon Aug 28 01:07:30 2000
	- Redid typemaps to separate input, optional-input, output,
	  optional-output, and const-output.
	- Add GSSAPI::is_valid() to allow users to test whether a NULL
	  object was returned.  Made all sub-modules except GSSAPI::Binding
	  into actual subclasses by setting @ISA in each to include
	  GSSAPI itself.
	- Add DESTROY method to GSSAPI::Context that deletes the context,
	  ignoring any errors.

0.10  Mon Aug 28 18:17:27 2000
	- Use SvOK() instead of comparing to &PL_sv_undef
	- Add gss_buffer_desc_out
	- Don't do the sv_setref_iv on output of PTROBJ_ or PTROBJ_OPT
	  if the value isn't changing.  This keeps the value from being
	  destructed while in use.
	- Because of that change, new() methods now return foo_out types
	- Newline terminate the stringification of a GSSAPI::Status object
	- This version has actually worked

0.11  Tue Aug 29 22:03:41 2000

0.12  Tue Nov  6 10:48:54 2001
	- Remove some unused constants from the .xs file.
	- Added missing '&'s to Context::accept and Context::export
	  method implementations.  Thanks to Jacob Gorm Hansen <jg@ioi.dk>
	  for finding this.
